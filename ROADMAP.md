This roadmap is a tentative plan for the core development team. Things change constantly as PRs come in and priorities change. 
But it will give you an idea of our current vision and plan.

  - Crossplatform builds
  - Backend service refactorings
  - Explore UI 
  - First login registration view
  
### Mid term (2-4 months)
  - Multi-Stat panel
  - React Panels 
  - Templating Query Editor UI Plugin hook
  
### Long term (4 - 8 months)

- Alerting improvements (silence, per series tracking, etc)
- Progress on React migration
- Change visualization (panel type) on the fly. 
- Multi stat panel (vertical version of singlestat with bars/graph mode with big number etc) 
- Repeat panel by query results 

### In a distant future far far away

- Meta queries 
- Integrated light weight TSDB
- Web socket & live data sources

### Outside contributions
