# Roadmap (2018-08-07)

This roadmap is a tentative plan for the core development team. Things change constantly as PRs come in and priorities change. 
But it will give you an idea of our current vision and plan. 
  
### Short term (1-2 months)
  - PRs & Bugs
  - Multi-Stat panel
  - Metrics & Log Explore UI 
 
### Mid term (2-4 months)  
  - React Panels 
  - Change visualization (panel type) on the fly. 
  - Templating Query Editor UI Plugin hook
  - Backend plugins
  
### Long term (4 - 8 months)
 - Alerting improvements (silence, per series tracking, etc)
 - Progress on React migration

### In a distant future far far away
 - Meta queries 
 - Integrated light weight TSDB
 - Web socket & live data sources

### Outside contributions
We know this is being worked on right now by contributors (and we hope to merge it when it's ready).
