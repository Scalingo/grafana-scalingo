# Documentation style guide

This style guide applies to all documentation created for Grafana products.

For information about how to write technical documentation, we suggest reviewing the content of the [Google Technical Writing courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing).

## Contributing

The *Documentation style guide* is a living document. Add to it whenever a style decision is made or a question is answered regarding style, grammar, or word choice.

## Published guides

For all items not covered in this guide, refer to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) and the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

## Spelling

The [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) tool is run for every change to catch common misspellings.

## Grafana-specific style

The following sections provide general guidelines on topics specific to Grafana documentation. Note that for the most part, these are *guidelines*, not rigid rules. If you have questions, ask in the #docs channel of Grafana Slack.

### General

* Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.
  - Passive: The heatmap visualization is displayed.
  - Active: Grafana displays the heatmap visualization.
* Write in the imperative second person. Examples: You can write a query. Click the panel. Close the window.
* Write in present tense.
  - Not: The panel will open.
  - Use: The panel opens. Grafana opens the panel.
* Do not use an ampersand (&) as an abbreviation for "and." 
  - **Exceptions:** If an ampersand is used in the Grafana UI, then match the UI.

### File naming conventions

- Files that are displayed in the help system should have names that are all lowercase, no spaces. Use hyphens instead of spaces. Example: glossary.md
- Documentation file names should match the title. **Note:** This only applies to new files at this time. Do not change the names of older files unless directed to do so.
- Internal reference file names should be all uppercase except the file extension. Example: CONTRIBUTING.md

### Headings

* Write headings in sentence case, not title case.
  - This is sentence case
  - This Is Title Case
* Task topic headings start with a verb.
  - Write a query. Create a dashboard.
* Concept and reference topic headings should be nouns or gerunds. Examples: Contributing to docs, Visualizations, Style guide
* Avoid following one heading with another heading.
* Avoid skipping heading levels. For example, an h1 should be followed by an h2 rather than an h3.
* Avoid having just one lower-level heading. For example, h1, h2, h2, h3, h3, h2 is a good order. Do no go h1, h2, h3, h2, h3, h2.
* Don't include parenthetical words like (Important!) in headings.

### Images

* Preferred format is .png
* File extension should be all lowercase.
* Preferred DPI is 72.
* Assume all graphics will be exclusively viewed on the web.
* Maximum image size is 3840px X 2160px.
* Screenshots should be readable, but not too large.

### Capitalization

* Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus are always capitalized unless part of a code block.
* API names are always Title Case, followed by "API"â€”for example, "Dashboard Permissions API"
* Git is always capitalized, unless part of a code block.
* Abbreviations are always capitalized (such as API, HTTP, ID, JSON, SQL, or URL) unless they are part of a code block.
* Menu and submenu titles always use sentence case: capitalize the first word, and lowercase the rest.
  - "Dashboards" when referring to the submenu title.
  - "Keyboard shortcuts" when referring to the submenu topic.
* Generic and plural versions are always lowercase.
  - Lowercase "dashboard" when referring to a dashboard generally.
  - Lowercase "dashboards" when referring to multiple dashboards.
* **Exceptions:** If a term is lowercased in the Grafana UI, then match the UI.

### Links and references

When referencing another document, use "Refer to" rather than alternatives such as "See" or "Check out."

Always give the reader some idea of what to expect in the reference. Avoid blind references, such as, "Refer to [this file](link)."

When possible, use the exact title of the page or section you are linking to as the link text.

**Example**
Refer to the [Documentation style guide](documentation-style-guide.md) for information about word usage and capitalization guidelines.

### Command line examples

* Do not assume everyone is using Linux. Make sure instructions include enough information for Windows and Mac users to successfully complete procedures.

* Do not add `$` before commands. Make it easy for users to copy and paste commands.

  * **Wrong:** `$ sudo yum install grafana`
  * **Right:** `sudo yum install grafana`

* Include `sudo` before commands that require `sudo` to work.

For terminal examples and Grafana configuration, use a `bash` code block:
```bash
sudo yum install grafana
```
For HTTP request/response, use an `http` code block:
```http
GET /api/dashboards/id/1/permissions HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJrIjoiT0tTcG1pUlY2RnVKZTFVaDFsNFZXdE9ZWmNrMkZYbk
```

### Word usage

Grafana products has some words, abbreviations, and slang particular to this discourse community.

#### checkout, check out

Two words if used as a verb, one word if used as a noun.

**Examples**

* Check out these new features!
* Proceed to checkout.

#### data source

Two words, not one

**Exceptions:**
* "datasource" used as an identifier
* "datasource" in a URL
* Use "data source" instead of "datasource" unless used as an identifier, in code, or as part of a URL.
* Spell out "repository" and avoid the shorter "repo."
* Use "Unix" as the preferred spelling (as opposed to "UNIX", or "unix") when referring to the family of operating systems.

#### display (verb)

*Display* is a transitive verb, which means it always needs a direct object.
* Correct, active voice: Grafana displays your list of active alarms.
* Correct, but passive voice: Your list of active alarms is displayed.
* Incorrect: The list of active alarms displays.

#### metadata

One word, not two.

#### open source, open-source

Do not hyphenate when used as an adjective unless the lack of hyphen would cause confusion. For example: _Open source software design is the most open open-source system I can imagine._ 

Do not hyphenate when it is used as a noun. For example: _Open source is the best way to develop software._

#### setup, set up

Two words if used as a verb, one word if used as a noun.

**Examples**

* Set up the workspace.
* Initial setup might take five minutes.
