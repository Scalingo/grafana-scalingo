# Invite a user to join an organization

When you invite users to join an organization, you assign the **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer** role which controls user access to the dashboards and data sources owned by the organization. Users receive an email that prompts them to accept the invitation.

- If you know that the user already has access Grafana and you know their user name, then you issue an invitation by entering their user name.
- If the user is new to Grafana, then use their email address to issue an invitation. The system automatically creates the user account on first sign in.

> **Note:** If you have [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators">}}) permissions, you can also manually [add a user to an organization]({{< relref "../../manage-users-and-permissions/manage-server-users/add-remove-user-to-org.md" >}}).

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges.
- If the user already has access to Grafana, obtain their user name.
- Determine the permissions you want to assign to the user. For more information about organization permissions, refer to [Organization roles]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions/#organization-roles">}}).
