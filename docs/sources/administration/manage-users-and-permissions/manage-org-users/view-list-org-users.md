> **Note:** If you have [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators">}}) permissions, you can also [view a global list of users]({{< relref "../../manage-users-and-permissions/manage-server-users/view-list-users.md" >}}) in the Server Admin section of Grafana.
