# View a list of users

You can see a list of users with accounts on your Grafana server. This action might be useful when you want to know which role you assigned to each user.

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have Grafana server administrator privileges

**To view a list of users**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.
1. Hover your cursor over the **Server Admin** (shield) icon until a menu appears, and click **Users**.

> **Note:** If you have [organization administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#organization-roles">}}) permissions and _not_ [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators">}}) permissions, you can still [view of list of users in a given organization]({{< relref "../../manage-users-and-permissions/manage-org-users/view-list-org-users.md" >}}).
