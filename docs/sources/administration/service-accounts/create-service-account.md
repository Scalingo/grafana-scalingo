# Create a service account in Grafana

A service account is a user account that you can use to run automated or compute workloads. For more information about how you can use service accounts, refer to [About service accounts]({{< relref "../service-accounts/about-service-accounts.md#">}}).

For more information about creating service accounts via the API, refer to [Create service account via API]({{< relref "../../http_api/serviceaccount.md#create-service-account">}}).

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have added the feature toggle for service accounts `serviceAccounts`. For more information about adding the feature toggle, refer to [Enable service accounts]({{< relref "./enable-service-accounts.md#">}}).
- Ensure you have permission to create and edit service accounts. By default, the organization administrator role is required to create and edit service accounts. For more information about user permissions, refer to [About users and permissions]({{< relref "../manage-users-and-permissions/about-users-and-permissions.md#">}}).

## To create a service account

1. Sign in to Grafana and hover your cursor over the organization icon in the sidebar.
1. Click **Service accounts**.
1. Click **New service account**.
1. Enter a **Display name**.
1. The display name must be unique as it determines the ID associated with the service account.
   - We recommend that you use a consistent naming convention when you name service accounts. A consistent naming convention can help you scale and maintain service accounts in the future.
   - You can change the display name at any time.
1. Click **Create service account**.
