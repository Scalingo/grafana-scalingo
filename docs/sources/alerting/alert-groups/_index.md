# Alert groups

Alert groups show grouped alerts from an Alertmanager instance. By default, the alerts are grouped by the label keys for the root policy in [notification policies]({{< relref "../notifications/" >}}). Grouping common alerts into a single alert group prevents duplicate alerts from being fired.

For more information, see:

- [Filter alerts by group]({{< relref "filter-alerts/" >}})
