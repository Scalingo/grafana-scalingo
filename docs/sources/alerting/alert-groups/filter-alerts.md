## Search by label

To use this filter option:

In **Search**, enter an existing label to view alerts matching the label. For example, `environment=production,region=~US|EU,severity!=warning`.

## Filter alerts by state

In **States**, select from Active, Suppressed, or Unprocessed states to view alerts matching your selected state. All other alerts are hidden.
