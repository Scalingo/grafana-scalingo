## Delete a contact point

For Grafana managed contact points, you can send a test notification which helps verify a contact point is configured correctly.

To delete a contact point

1. In the Alerting page, click **Contact points** to open the page listing existing contact points.
1. Find the contact point to delete, then click **Delete** (trash icon).
1. In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes, delete**.

> **Note:** You cannot delete contact points that are in use by a notification policy. You will have to either delete the [notification policy]({{< relref "../notifications/" >}}) or update it to use another contact point.
