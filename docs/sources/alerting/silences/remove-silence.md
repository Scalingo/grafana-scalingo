# Remove silences

Silences stop notifications from getting created.

1. In the Grafana menu, click the **Alerting** (bell) icon to open the Alerting page listing existing alerts.
1. Click **Silences** to view the list of existing silences.
1. Select the silence you want to end, then click **Unsilence**.

> **Note:** You cannot remove a silence manually. Silences that have ended are retained and listed for five days.
