## Create a dashboard

Dashboards and panels allow you to show your data in visual form. Each panel needs at least one query to display a visualization.

**Before you begin:**

- Ensure that you have the proper permissions. For more information about permissions, refer to [About users and permissions]({{< relref "../../../administration/roles-and-permissions/" >}}).
- Identify the dashboard to which you want to add the panel.
- Understand the query language of the target data source.
- Ensure that data source for which you are writing a query has been added. For more information about adding a data source, refer to [Add a data source]({{< relref "../../../administration/data-source-management#add-a-data-source" >}}) if you need instructions.

**To create a dashboard**:

1. Sign in to Grafana, hover your cursor over **Dashboard**, and click **+ New Dashboard**.
1. Click **Add a new panel**.
1. In the first line of the **Query** tab, click the drop-down list and select a data source.
1. Write or construct a query in the query language of your data source.

   For more information about data sources, refer to [Data sources]({{< relref "../../../datasources/" >}}) for specific guidelines.

1. In the Visualization list, select a visualization type.

   Grafana displays a preview of your query results with the visualization applied.

   For more information about individual visualizations, refer to [Visualizations options]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/visualizations/" >}}).

1. Refer to the following documentation for ways you can adjust panel settings.

   While not required, most visualizations need some adjustment before they properly display the information that you need.

   - [Configure value mappings]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/configure-value-mappings" >}})
   - [Visualization-specific options]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/visualizations/" >}})
   - [Override field values]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/configure-overrides/" >}})
   - [Configure thresholds]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/configure-thresholds/" >}})
   - [Configure standard options]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/configure-standard-options/" >}})

1. Add a note to describe the visualization (or describe your changes) and then click **Save** in the upper-right corner of the page.

   Notes can be helpful if you need to revert the dashboard to a previous version.

## Configure repeating rows

You can configure Grafana to dynamically add panels or rows to a dashboard based on the value of a variable. Variables dynamically change your queries across all rows in a dashboard. For more information about repeating panels, refer to [Configure repeating panels](../../panels/configure-panel-options/#configure-repeating-panels).

To see an example of repeating rows, refer to [Dashboard with repeating rows](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000153/repeat-rows). The example shows that you can also repeat rows if you have variables set with `Multi-value` or `Include all values` selected.

**Before you begin:**

- Ensure that the query includes a multi-value variable.

**To configure repeating rows:**

1. On the dashboard home page, click **Add panel**.

1. On the **Add a panel** dialog box, click **Add a new row**.

1. Hover over the row title and click the cog icon.

1. On the **Row Options** dialog box, add a title and select the variable for which you want to add repeating rows.

> **Note:** To provide context to dashboard users, add the variable to the row title.

## Move a panel

You can place a panel on a dashboard in any location.

1. Open the dashboard.

1. Click the panel title and drag the panel to the new location.

## Resize a panel

You can size a dashboard panel to suits your needs.

1. Open the dashboard.

1. To adjust the size of the panel, click and drag the lower-right corner of the panel.
