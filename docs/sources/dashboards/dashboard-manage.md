## Manage dashboards

When managing dashboads, you can use:

- Select a time period for a dashboard using the [Time range controls]({{< relref "time-range-controls/" >}}) in the upper right of the dashboard.
- Tag dashboards.
- Use [templating]({{< relref "../variables/" >}}) to make them more dynamic and interactive.
- Use [annotations]({{< relref "annotations/" >}}) to display event data across panels. This can help correlate the time series data in the panel with other events.
- Use the dashboard picker for quick, searchable access to all dashboards in a particular organization.

You can also [share dashboards]({{< relref "../sharing/share-dashboard/" >}}) in a variety of ways.
