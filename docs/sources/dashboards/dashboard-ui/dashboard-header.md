- **Side menubar toggle** (1): This option toggles the side menu. It provides access to features unrelated to a dashboard such as users, organizations, data sources, and alerting.
- **Dashboard dropdown** (2): Use this option to view the current dashboard name. From here, you can:
  - Select another dashboard name to easily switch to that dashboard.
  - Create a new dashboard or folder, import existing dashboards, and manage dashboard playlists.
- **Add panel** (3): Use this option to add a new panel to the current dashboard.
- **Star dashboard** (4): Use this option to star (or unstar) the current dashboard. Starred dashboards show up on your own homw dashboard by default. It is a convenient way to mark Dashboards that you're interested in.
- **Share dashboard** (5): Use this option to share the current dashboard by creating a link or create a static snapshot of it. You must save the dashboard before sharing.
