# Data sources

Grafana can query and integrate with many different types of databases. This is done by adding a **data source** of the type you want to query or integrate with.
When you have created and configured a data source you are ready to start exploring and visualizing data, either in Explore or in a new Dashboard. A dashboard is composed of [panels]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/" >}}), each panel contains a set of queries to one or more data sources.

You can also create new a alert rule from a data source query and have Grafana continuously evaluate it and notify you when things change.

You can also query data sources without building a dashboard by using the [Explore]({{< relref "../explore/" >}}) feature.

## Manage data sources

Only users with the [organization administrator role]({{< relref "../administration/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles" >}}) can add or remove data sources.
To access data source management tools in Grafana as an administrator, navigate to **Configuration > Data Sources** in the Grafana sidebar.

For details on data source management, including instructions on how to add data sources and configure user permissions for queries, refer to the [administration documentation]({{< relref "../administration/data-source-management" >}}).

## Use query editors

Each data source's **query editor** provides a customized user interface that helps you write queries that take advantage of its unique capabilities.
You use a data source's query editor when you create queries in [dashboard panels]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/query-transform-data" >}}) or [Explore]({{< relref "../explore/" >}}).

Because of the differences between query languages, each data source query editor looks and functions differently.
Depending on your data source, the query editor might provide auto-completion features, metric names, variable suggestions, or a visual query-building interface.

For example, this video demonstrates the visual Prometheus query builder:

For general information about querying in Grafana, and common options and user interface elements across all query editors, refer to [Query and transform data]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/" >}}).

## Built-in core data sources

These built-in core data sources are included in the Grafana documentation:

- [Alertmanager]({{< relref "./alertmanager/" >}})
- [AWS CloudWatch]({{< relref "./aws-cloudwatch/" >}})
- [Azure Monitor]({{< relref "./azure-monitor/" >}})
- [Elasticsearch]({{< relref "./elasticsearch/" >}})
- [Google Cloud Monitoring]({{< relref "./google-cloud-monitoring/" >}})
- [Graphite]({{< relref "./graphite/" >}})
- [InfluxDB]({{< relref "./influxdb/" >}})
- [Jaeger]({{< relref "./jaeger/" >}})
- [Loki]({{< relref "./loki/" >}})
- [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)]({{< relref "./mssql/" >}})
- [MySQL]({{< relref "./mysql/" >}})
- [OpenTSDB]({{< relref "./opentsdb/" >}})
- [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "./postgres/" >}})
- [Prometheus]({{< relref "./prometheus/" >}})
- [Tempo]({{< relref "./tempo/" >}})
- [Testdata]({{< relref "./testdata/" >}})
- [Zipkin]({{< relref "./zipkin/" >}})

## Special data sources

Grafana also includes three special data sources:

- **Grafana:** A built-in data source that generates random walk data and can poll the [Testdata]({{< relref "./testdata/" >}}) data source.
  This helps you test visualizations and run experiments.
- **Mixed:** An abstraction that lets you query multiple data sources in the same panel.
  When you select Mixed, you can then select a different data source for each new query that you add.
  - The first query uses the data source that was selected before you selected **Mixed**.
  - You can't change an existing query to use the Mixed data source.
  - Grafana Play example: [Mixed data sources](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000100/mixed-datasources?orgId=1)
- **Dashboard:** A data source that uses the result set from another panel in the same dashboard.
