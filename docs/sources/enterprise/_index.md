## License file management

To download your Grafana Enterprise license log in to your [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com) account and go to your **Org
Profile**. In the side menu there is a section for Grafana Enterprise licenses. At the bottom of the license
details page there is **Download Token** link that will download the *license.jwt* file containing your license.

Place the *license.jwt* file in Grafana's data folder. This is usually located at `/var/lib/grafana/data` on Linux systems.

You can also configure a custom location for the license file via the ini setting:

```bash
[enterprise]
license_path = /company/secrets/license.jwt
```

This setting can also be set via ENV variable which is useful if you're running Grafana via docker and have a custom
volume where you have placed the license file. In this case set the ENV variable `GF_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_PATH` to point
to the location of your license file.
