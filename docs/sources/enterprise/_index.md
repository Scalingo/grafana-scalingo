## Enhanced security features

Grafana Enterprise includes integrations with more ways to authenticate your users and enhanced authorization capabilities.

### Data source permissions

[Data source permissions]({{< relref "datasource_permissions.md" >}}) allow you to restrict query access to only specific teams and users.

### Enhanced LDAP integration

With Grafana Enterprise [enhanced LDAP]({{< relref "enhanced_ldap.md" >}}), you can set up synchronization between LDAP groups and Grafana teams.

### SAML authentication

[SAML authentication]({{< relref "saml.md" >}}) enables your Grafana Enterprise users to authenticate with SAML.

### Team sync

[Team sync]({{< relref "team-sync.md" >}}) allows you to set up synchronization between teams in Grafana and teams in your auth provider so that your users automatically end up in the right team.

Supported auth providers:

* [Auth Proxy]({{< relref "../auth/auth-proxy.md#team-sync-enterprise-only">}})
* [GitHub OAuth]({{< relref "../auth/github.md#team-sync-enterprise-only" >}})

## Reporting

[Reporting]({{< relref "reporting.md" >}}) allows you to take any dashboard, generate a PDF report, and set up a schedule to have it emailed to whoever you choose.

## White labeling

[White labeling]({{< relref "white-labeling.md" >}}) allows you to replace the Grafana brand and logo with your own corporate brand and logo. You can also change footer links to point to your custom resources.

## License file management

To download your Grafana Enterprise license log in to your [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com) account and go to your **Org Profile**. In the side menu there is a section for Grafana Enterprise licenses. At the bottom of the license details page there is **Download Token** link that will download the *license.jwt* file containing your license.

Place the *license.jwt* file in Grafana's data folder. This is usually located at `/var/lib/grafana/data` on Linux systems.

You can also configure a custom location for the license file via the ini setting:

```bash
[enterprise]
license_path = /company/secrets/license.jwt
```

This setting can also be set with an environment variable, which is useful if you're running Grafana with Docker and have a custom volume where you have placed the license file. In this case, set the environment variable `GF_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_PATH` to point to the location of your license file.
