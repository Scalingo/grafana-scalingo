# Grafana Enterprise configuration

This page describes Grafana Enterprise-specific configuration options that you can specify in a `.ini` configuration file or using environment variables. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../administration/configuration.md" >}}) for more information about available configuration options.

## [enterprise]

### license_path

Local filesystem path to Grafana Enterprise's license file.
Defaults to `<paths.data>/license.jwt`.

### license_text

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

When set to the text representation (i.e. content of the license file)
of the license, Grafana will evaluate and apply the given license to
the instance.

### auto_refresh_license

> **Note:** Available in Grafana Enterprise v7.4+.

When enabled, Grafana will send the license and usage statistics to
the license issuer. If the license has been updated on the issuer's
side to be valid for a different number of users or a new duration,
your Grafana instance will be updated with the new terms
automatically. Defaults to `true`.

## [white_labeling]
