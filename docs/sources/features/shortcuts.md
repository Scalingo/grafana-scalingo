# Keyboard shortcuts

{{< docs-imagebox img="/img/docs/v50/shortcuts.png" max-width="20rem" class="docs-image--right" >}}

Grafana v4 introduces a number of really powerful keyboard shortcuts. You can now focus a panel
by hovering over it with your mouse. With a panel focused you can simple hit `e` to toggle panel
edit mode, or `v` to toggle fullscreen mode. `p` `r` removes the panel. `p` `s` opens share
modal.

Hit `?` on your keyboard to open the shortcuts help modal.
