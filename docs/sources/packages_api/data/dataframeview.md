This abstraction will present the contents of a DataFrame as if it were a well typed javascript object Vector.

<b>Signature</b>

```typescript
export declare class DataFrameView<T = any> implements Vector<T> 
```
<b>Import</b>

```typescript
import { DataFrameView } from '@grafana/data';
```

## Remarks

The [DataFrameView.get()](./data/dataframeview/get.md) is optimized for use in a loop and will return same object. See function for more details.
