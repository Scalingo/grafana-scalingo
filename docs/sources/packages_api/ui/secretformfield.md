### SecretFormField variable

Form field that has 2 states configured and not configured. If configured it will not show its contents and adds a reset button that will clear the input and makes it accessible. In non configured state it behaves like normal form field. This is used for passwords or anything that is encrypted on the server and is later returned encrypted to the user (like datasource passwords).
