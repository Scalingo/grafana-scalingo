# Panels and visualizations

The _panel_ is the basic visualization building block in Grafana.
Each panel has a query editor specific to the data source selected in the panel.
The query editor allows you to build a query that returns the data you want to visualize.

There are a wide variety of styling and formatting options for each panel.
Panels can be dragged, dropped, and resized to rearrange them on the dashboard.

Before you add a panel, ensure that you have configured a data source.

- For more information about adding and managing data sources as an administrator, refer to [Data source management]({{< relref "../administration/data-source-management/" >}}).
- For details about using specific data sources, refer to [Data sources]({{< relref "../datasources/" >}}).
