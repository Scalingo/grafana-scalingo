# Configure repeating rows

As seen above with the panels you can also repeat rows if you have variables set with `Multi-value` or
`Include all value` selection option.

## Before you begin

- Ensure that the query includes a multi-value variable.

**To configure repeating rows**:

1. On the dashboard home page, click **Add panel**.

1. On the **Add a panel** dialog box, click **Add a new row**.

1. Hover over the row title and click the cog icon.

1. On the `Row Options` configuration panel, select the variable for which you want to add repeating rows.

> To help provide context to dashboard users, add the variable to the row title.
