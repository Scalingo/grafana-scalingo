# About Grafana panel libraries

A library panel is a reusable panel that you can use in any dashboard. When you make a change to a library panel, that change propagates to all instances of where the panel is used. Library panels streamline reuse of panels across multiple dashboards.

You can save a library panel in a folder alongside saved dashboards.
