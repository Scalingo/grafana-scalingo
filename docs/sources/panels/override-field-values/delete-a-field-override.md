# Delete a field override

Delete a field override when you no longer need it.

When you delete an override, the appearance of value defaults to its original format. This change impacts dashboards and dashboard users that rely on an affected panel.

1. Edit the panel that contains the override you want to delete.
1. In panel display options, click the **Overrides** tab.
1. Click the override you want to delete and then click the associated trash icon.
