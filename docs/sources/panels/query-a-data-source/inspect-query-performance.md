# Inspect query performance

The **Stats** tab displays statistics that tell you how long your query takes, how many queries you send, and the number of rows returned. This information can help you troubleshoot your queries, especially if any of the numbers are unexpectedly high or low.

## Before you begin

- [Add a panel to a dashboard]({{< relref "../working-with-panels/add-panel.md" >}}).
- [Add a query]({{< relref "../query-a-data-source/add-a-query.md" >}}).

**To inspect query performance**:

1. Edit the panel that contains the query with performance you want to inspect.
1. In the query editor, click **Query Inspector**.
1. Click **Stats**.

Statistics are displayed in read-only format.
