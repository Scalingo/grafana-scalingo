# Delete a transformation

We recommend that you remove transformations that you don't need. When you delete a transformation, you remove the data from the visualization.

## Before you begin

- Identify all dashboards that rely on the transformation and inform impacted dashboard users.

**To delete a transformation**:

1. Open a panel for editing.
1. Click the **Transform** tab.
1. Click the trash icon next to the transformation you want to delete.
