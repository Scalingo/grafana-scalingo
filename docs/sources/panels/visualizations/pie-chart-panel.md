# Pie chart v2 panel

> **Note:** This documentation refers to a beta feature.

The pie chart displays reduced series, or values in a series, from one or more queries, as they relate to each other, in the form of slices of a pie. The arc length, area and central angle of a slice are all proportional to the slices value, as it relates to the sum of all values. This type of chart is best used when you want a quick comparison of a small set of values in an aesthetically pleasing form.
