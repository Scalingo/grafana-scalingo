# Apply color to series and fields

In addition to specifying color based on thresholds, you can configure the color of series and field data. The color options and their effect on the visualization depends on the visualization you are working with. Some visualizations have different color options.

You can specify a single color, or select a continuous (gradient) color schemes, based on a value.
Continuous color interpolates a color using the percentage of a value relative to min and max.

## Before you begin
