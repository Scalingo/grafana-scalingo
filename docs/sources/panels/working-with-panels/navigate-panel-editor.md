# Navigate the Grafana panel editor

This page describes the parts of the Grafana panel editor.

1. Panel header: The header section lists the dashboard in which the panel appears and the following controls:

   - **Dashboard settings (gear) icon -** Click to access the dashboard settings.
   - **Discard -** Discards changes you have made to the panel since you last saved the dashboard.
   - **Save -** Saves changes you made to the panel.
   - **Apply -** Applies changes you made and closes the panel editor, returning you to the dashboard. You will have to save the dashboard to persist the applied changes.

2. Visualization preview: The visualization preview section contains the following options:

   - **Table view -** Convert any visualization to a table so that you can see the data. Table views are useful for troubleshooting.
   - **Fill -** The visualization preview fills the available space. If you change the width of the side pane or height of the bottom pane the visualization changes to fill the available space.
   - **Actual -** The visualization preview will have the exact size as the size on the dashboard. If not enough space is available, the visualization will scale down preserving the aspect ratio.
   - **Time range controls -** For more information, refer to [Time range controls]({{< relref "../../dashboards/time-range-controls.md" >}}).

3. Data section: The data section contains tabs where you enter queries, transform your data, and create alert rules (if applicable).

   - **Query tab -** Select your data source and enter queries here. For more information, refer to [Add a query]({{< relref "../query-a-data-source/add-a-query.md" >}}).

   - **Transform tab -** Apply data transformations. For more information, refer to [Transform data]({{< relref "../transform-data/_index.md" >}}).
   - **Alert tab -** Write alert rules. For more information, refer to [Overview of Grafana 8 alerting]({{< relref "../../alerting/unified-alerting/_index.md" >}}).

4. Panel display options: The display options section contains tabs where you configure almost every aspect of your data visualization, including:

   - [Apply color to series and fields]({{< relref "./apply-color-to-series.md" >}})
   - [Format a standard field]({{< relref "./format-standard-fields.md" >}})
   - [Add a title and description to a panel]({{< relref "./add-title-and-description.md" >}})

> Not all options are available for each visualization.
