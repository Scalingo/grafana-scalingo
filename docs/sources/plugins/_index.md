# Plugins

Plugins make it easy to create and add any kind of panel, data source or complete
application, to show your data or improve your favorite dashboards.

Grafana has a strong community of contributors and plugin developers.
By making it easier to develop and install plugins we hope that the community
can grow even stronger and develop new plugins that we would never think about.

You can discover available plugins on [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/plugins)
