## Step 1. Install Grafana and build your first dashboard

Use the instructions in [Getting started with Grafana]({{< relref "../../getting-started/getting-started.md" >}}) to:

- Install Grafana.
- Log in to Grafana.
- Create your first dashboard.

You can also configure a [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/) instance to display system metrics without having to host Grafana yourself.
